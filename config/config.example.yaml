# Team configurations

# Member Format Options:
# ----------------------
# Option 1 (Simple format): List of username strings
#   - Just GitHub usernames as strings
#   - Members are matched by index with Jira members
#   - Shown below for the Native team
#
# Option 2 (NEW - With display names): List of dicts with username and name
#   - Supports displaying full names instead of usernames in UI
#   - Format: - username: "github-username"
#             name: "Full Name"
#   - Example shown in comments below
#
# Option 3 (Explicit mapping): Member dicts with github/jira keys
#   - More explicit, safer when GitHub and Jira usernames differ
#   - Enables per-person Jira metrics on person dashboard
#
# NEW DISPLAY NAME FORMAT (uncomment to use):
# github:
#   members:
#     - username: "daniella-b"
#       name: "Daniella Barsony"

# Parallel Data Collection (optional)
# Speeds up data collection by running teams, persons, repos, and filters concurrently.
# This reduces collection time from ~18 hours to ~4 hours for 12 date ranges (4-5x speedup).
#
# Defaults (if not specified):
#   enabled: true

# Performance Score Weights (optional)
# These weights determine how different metrics contribute to performance scores
# in team and member comparisons. All weights must sum to 1.0 (100%).
#
# If not specified, system uses these defaults:
#   GitHub metrics (55%): PRs, Reviews, Commits, Cycle Time, Merge Rate
#   DORA metrics (30%): Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, CFR, MTTR
#   Jira metrics (15%): Jira Completed
#
# You can customize these via the Settings page in the dashboard
# (http://localhost:5001/settings) without editing this file.

#   merge_rate: 0.05             # PR merge success rate (higher is better)
#   jira_completed: 0.15         # Jira issues completed (higher is better)
#   # DORA metrics (requires releases and incident tracking)
#   deployment_frequency: 0.10   # Deployments per week (higher is better)
